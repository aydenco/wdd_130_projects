      MARCH INTRO HEADER <br>
      M.A.R.C.H. is an acronym describing and prioritizing the steps of trauma first aid. It is typically used by
      tactical organizations for care during combat, but can be utilized in civilian situations as well. <br>
      M.A.R.C.H. stands for Massive Hemorrhaging, Airway, Respiratory, Circulation, and Hypothermia. Below is a short
      summary of each step. Click on a step to learn more. <br>

      MASSIVE HEMORRHAGING <br>
      First check the patient for any significant bleeding. Staunch the bleeding as quickly and completely as possible.
      Depending on where the injury is, this is done with a tourniquet or by packing the wound with gauze and applying
      pressure. <br>

      AIRWAY <br>
      Second, examine the patient’s airway. Make sure it is clear of obstruction, and if unconscious, the patient’s head
      and neck are in good alignment to allow proper breathing. This may be remedied as easily as using a jaw thrust, or
      it may require a nasal cannula to maintain a proper airway. <br>

      RESPIRATORY <br>
      Third, observe the patient’s breathing. Check if the patient’s chest is rising and falling evenly and in regular
      intervals. Feel the patient’s chest and back, looking for punctures that may cause tension pneumothorax. <br>

      CIRCULATION <br>
      Once any major bleeding has been treated, and all other steps have been addressed, look for signs of shock and
      lack of blood circulation. Check pulses at the wrist and other extremities, and look for discoloration or bruising
      in the skin. <br>

      HYPOTHERMIA <br>
      Hypothermia is not just limited to frigid landscapes. It can be caused by prolonged shock or major blood loss. It
      is important to make sure the patient stays warm enough, even if it is hot outside.

    <h3>Massive Hemorrhage</h3>
    <p>
      MASSIVE HEMORRHAGE (PAGE 2) <br>

      This will be the first of each MARCH step page that goes into more detail. It links from the main page from the
      MASSIVE HEMORRHAGE button. For the project, the other steps will not be expanded. <br>

      Opening <br>
      Massive Hemorrhage is when a life threatening amount of blood is being lost. Because it happens so fast, it is the
      first priority when assessing a trauma victim. <br>

      Hemorrhaging wounds are treated differently depending on where they are located on the body. Most wounds are
      categorized to either the torso or an extremity. <br>

      Extremities <br>
      Extremity wounds may seem less life threatening, but major blood vessels such as the axillary arteries in the arms
      or femoral arteries in the legs can pump large amounts of blood out of the body if ruptured. <br>

      Excluding the neck and head, extremity wounds are treated with a tourniquet. If the bleed is small enough, packing
      gauze, clotting agent, and a pressure dressing may be enough. Otherwise, apply tourniquet quickly and properly.
      <br>

      A tourniquet turns circular tension from the windlass into compression tension around the limb. The goal of a
      tourniquet is to press all the blood vessels in the limb into the bone in order to stop blood flow. <br>

      Torso <br>
      Torso wounds can be more complex than extremity wounds due to the essential organs in the chest and abdomen. It is
      usually not possible to pinch off the source of bleeding, so wound packing and pressure are the preferred method.

      RESOURCES (PAGE 3) <br>

      Below is a list of various websites that you can use to learn more, find training, and build a quality first aid
      kit. <br>

      <a href="https://www.redcross.org/">redcross.org</a> - Founded in 1881, the Red Cross is one of the most
      recognized medical organizations. Their website provides lots of useful information about first aid, and you can
      sign up to get certified in things like CPR or BLS. <br>
      <a href="https://www.stopthebleed.org/">stopthebleed.org</a> - Stop the Bleed is another valuable resource for the
      most recent information and training in treating massive hemorrhaging. <br>
      <a href="https://www.c-tecc.org/">www.c-tecc.org</a> - The Committee for Tactical Emergency Casualty Care is based
      off of its military counterpart, CoTCCC, which is responsible for creating the MARCH Protocol. The CoTECC is
      geared towards first responder, search and rescue, and civillian situations. <br>
      <a href="https://sheepdogresponse.com/">sheepdogresponse.com/live-training</a> - Sheepdog Response is a tactical
      training organization that is focused in self-defense and other combat skills, but they also offer an excellent
      trauma response course perfect for the average citizen. Their team is made up of a variety of military experts,
      including special ops medics. They also sell a quality IFAK and other medical supplies.
      <a href="https://www.narescue.com/">narescue.com</a> - North American Rescue is seen as the industry standard in
      first response medical supplies. Any quality prebuilt first aid kit will include their products. They also offer a
      multitude of training courses.
